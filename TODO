    #High priority:

    ∙When the script finnishes it asks the user if they want to keep the log
     file or delete it. But that log file contains some essential things that
     the user needs to see (such as pacman's output when it installs libre
     replacements). These things should be output to the terminal, as well as
     written in the log. Use `tee' to do this.

    #Low priority:

    ∙Make a brief explanation of everything it does in the comments at the top
     of the code.
    ∙After installing the libre mirrorlist, it should ask they user if
     `rankmirrors' should be run on the mirrorlist.
